In some examples, Spring Cloud configuration servers use a different parent, and don't have the dependency management section. I found this
worked fine in Eclipse, but caused IDEA to go wobbly. I think it causes problems in this particular project, because the external libraries are
at the project level, not the module.

Anyway, using the POM as generated by the Spring Initializr works fine.
